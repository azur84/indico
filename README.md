## Who to play ?

To start, you need to find one of the many QR codes hidden around the city.
After that, the game will direct you to a new location where you can find another QR code.
Each time you scan a QR code, you get an additional clue to the murderer.
Once all the clues have been found, the game gives you one last place to finish the game.

## Other information

The website has been designed for use on a phone.
